This tool is used to automatically generate and update the
ELIXIR registry [3] debian med collection of resources, using
the debian packages metadata. This registry uses EDAM [1],
which addresses the categorisation of tools and collections 
of tools that contribute to computational biology in its 
broadest sense. For a translation, some bits are meant to be 
read by traditional means as with dpkg-parsechangelog. For the 
EDAM annotation we had chosen a format compatible with YAML [2].
