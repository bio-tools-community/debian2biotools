EDAM
====

The EDAM ontology [1] addresses the categorisation of tools
and collections of tools that contribute to computational
biology in its broadest sense. For a translation, some
bits are meant to be read by traditional means as with
dpkg-parsechangelog, for the EDAM annotation we had chosen
a format compatible with YAML [2].
